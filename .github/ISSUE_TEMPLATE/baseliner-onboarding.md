### Description

**What needs to be done?**
We need you to setup your workflow and computer to baseline METR tasks.

### Business Driver

**Why do we need to do it?**
They are paying us for this because it will help them estimate when AI has surpassed human performance in various expertise domains.

### Scope

**What are the high level steps to resolve this issue?**
- [ ] Please join the [METR baselines Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/baselinesworkspace/shared_invite/zt-2rmjeuskg-pewlCJ7qig_ZHzZu0_P_3g) using this link as soon as you can. METR will use this Slack to communicate with you about baselines. 
- [ ] Please also read through [the baselining handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2JZpCqVFaj0yLYuBO7uxdEvKmshfHtDlCt1rpROvgA/edit?usp=sharing).
- [ ] [Join the METR tailscale vpn](https://login.tailscale.com/uinv/i013956e5315d1a3a) â€” this will be necessary for gaining access to the server.
- [ ] Send Joel a list of the METR tasks that you have already seen personally [on slack](https://join.slack.com/t/baselinesworkspace/shared_invite/zt-2rmjeuskg-pewlCJ7qig_ZHzZu0_P_3g). Being previously exposed to a task will mess up the baseline, so we need to know about it in order to assign you to the appropriate tasks.
